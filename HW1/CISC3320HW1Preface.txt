Assignment: Define the minimum pid as 300 and the maximum pid as 5000, the
create three methods, one that populates a data structure counting the pids,
another that allocates the pids, and finally one releasing a pid. Return -1 if the
method doesn't work and 1 if it does. 

Assumptions: Since I'm coding in Javascript, I had to make a few assumptions, first off
there are no declarative states in Javascript so I completely 86'ed it.
Second, for the sake of understanding the output better, 
I decided to add alerts. Third, I decided to
create two other constants, the data structure & the difference
of the pids. Finally, not an assumption but I wanted to state that
in order to check, I created another function call that runs the
other functions.
