###PROGRAMMING HOMEWORK GUIDELINES 

The goal of programming assignments in CIS 3320 is to allow the student to get ‘up close and personal’ with some of the Operating System algorithms and concepts that are presented in lecture. 

So that the activity is representative of the type that a systems or application programmer would experience in the field, students have the choice of designing and implementing their programs individually or in pairs.  No more than two students may collaborate on a programming assignment. Even when collaborating, each student shall submit the homework on Blackboard individually. 

#THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS ARE MANDATORY FOR EACH HOMEWORK SUBMISSION 

Identify the author(s) of the assignment and the role that each played in creating the assignment.  

Restate the problem statement in your own words.  

Identify any assumptions that you have made about the problem statement. (You are advised to review these with me). 

Provide a design document that describes each module, its parameters, and its function.  

Provide a file containing output that demonstrates that your code meets the requirements of the assignment. If you are building an API as in Programming Problem 3.20, you need to create client functions that exercise these API functions in a way that demonstrates that each operates per the requirements. 

Provide a file containing the code that generated the output. 

 

#NOTE:  
1. All homework submissions are to be done via Blackboard.  
2. Each of these shall be presented in a separate file.  
3. All files should be uploaded separately. DO NOT USE ZIP or RAR files.  

 

#Please note the following about programming assignments in CISC 3320. 

The assignment is due on the due date. If you have not completed it, submit what you have done. There will be no extensions. A deadline in the field is a hard deadline. Get accustomed to this reality. 

Assume that all submitted code will be executed to verify that it produces the results that are claimed.  

Assume that each code submission will be programmatically compared with every other code submission in the class to identify any instance of partial or total undocumented collaboration.  

The first three programming assignments will build on each other. Take care to implement your solution so that modifications will not require a total rewrite of your code.  

Your grade will be based first on the accuracy of the output, and second by the quality of the code (this includes all required documentation, choice of variable names, and meaningful comments).
