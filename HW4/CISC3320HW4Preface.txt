Assignment: Recreate some disk scheduling algorithms.

Assumptions: First off, I embeded the example input given to use within my code rather
than making the user input whatever values they want. If you want to change it all you need to do
is change the values on the top. The array is the same, the head is 100, and the total cylinders
used is 4999. All I did was find the steps, there was no specification to do much else, unless I 
misread the homework. In the slides you say for the SCAN algorithm that you choose between which side is
shorter but in the textbook it says about the SCAN Algorithm, "In the SCAN algorithm, the disk arm starts at one end of the disk and moves
toward the other end, servicing requests as it reaches each cylinder, until it gets
to the other end of the disk. ... we need to know
the direction of head movement in addition to the headâ€™s current position.
Assuming that the disk arm is moving toward 0 and that the initial head
position is again 53." (Abraham 475) This doesn't specify the idea that we need to go towards the shorter end. I'll assume that the
slides are right in this case but for future classes, you may want to look into this.
