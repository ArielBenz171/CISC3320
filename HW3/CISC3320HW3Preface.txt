Assignment: Use mutex locks in order to protect your code from race conditions.

Assumptions: Javascript is a single threaded language so there is mostly no need
for mutex locks. One side effect of this is that mutex locks are annoying to run
in Javascript, the only possible way is to create a full-fleged web app, which I think
is a bit unreasonable for this homework. So I decided just to just import mutex locks and write
out the hypothetical program including mutex locks.
