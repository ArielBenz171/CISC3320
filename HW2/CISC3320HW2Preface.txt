Assignment: Create a function that allows you to create multiple threads at once:
this entails to open a pid, then let them sleep for a random value of time, and finally 
once the time is up, release the pid. 

Assumptions: Javascript doesn't have a sleep function and it isn't
obvious on how to replace it so I looked online and found some code
that could replace the sleep function. (https://www.sitepoint.com/delay-sleep-pause-wait/)
In the document given to us for HW2, we were asked to use the example 100, however
the IDE that I used for this problem couldn't handle 100. So I checked my work somewhere
else and it worked for 100 but my output page only shows a 10 example. All you need to do
to check 100 is to change the for loop at the end of the code from 10 to 100. As well,
I decided to have a cap at a 10 millisecond wait and keep the value as a float parameter
rather than an integer.
